The system has been significantly upgraded with advanced features including market timing analysis, risk-adjusted scoring, competitive positioning insights, and dynamic confidence assessment.

## Architecture

### Two-Tier Approach
1. **Primary**: LLM-powered insights using GPT-4o (with Claude-3.5 Sonnet fallback)
2. **Secondary**: Rule-based scoring system (100-point scale) for validation and fallback

### Enhanced Features (New)
- **Market Timing Analysis**: Assesses optimal entry timing based on growth momentum, competition maturity, and problem urgency
- **Risk-Adjusted Scoring**: Calculates risk-adjusted scores considering market challenges, barriers to entry, and data quality
- **Competitive Positioning**: Analyzes positioning opportunities, competitive advantages, and strategic recommendations
- **Dynamic Confidence Factors**: Multi-dimensional confidence assessment based on data quality, consistency, credibility, and depth

## Data Integration Pipeline

The system integrates outputs from all Python research modules:

### 1. Business Classification
- Primary/secondary industry classification
- Product type identification
- Target audience analysis

### 2. Market Sizing Analysis
- TAM/SAM/SOM calculations
- Growth rate analysis
- Market drivers and challenges
- Confidence scoring

### 3. Competitive Analysis
- Competitor identification and analysis
- Market gap identification
- Barriers to entry assessment
- Market concentration analysis

### 4. Problem Validation

## Enhanced Features Deep Dive

### Market Timing Analysis
Evaluates optimal market entry timing using three key factors:

**Growth Momentum (40% weight)**
- Explosive growth (≥20%): 40 points
- Strong growth (≥10%): 30 points  
- Moderate growth (≥5%): 20 points

**Competition Maturity (30% weight)**
- No competitors: 30 points (first-mover advantage)
- 1-3 competitors: 25 points (early market)
- 4-7 competitors: 15 points (maturing market)
- 8+ competitors: Risk of late entry

**Problem Urgency (30% weight)**
- High urgency (≥8/10): 30 points
- Moderate urgency (≥6/10): 20 points
- Low urgency: Delayed adoption risk

### Risk-Adjusted Scoring
Adjusts base recommendation scores based on identified risks:

**Risk Factors**
- Market challenges: -3 points per challenge
- Barriers to entry: -4 points per barrier
- Alternative solutions: -4 to -8 points
- Data quality issues: -10 points

**Confidence Impact**
- HIGH: Risk adjustment > 15 points
- MEDIUM: Risk adjustment 5-15 points
- LOW: Risk adjustment < 5 points
