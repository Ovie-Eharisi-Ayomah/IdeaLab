  "reasoning": "INDUSTRY ANALYSIS:\nThe business idea involves a mobile app designed for emergency situations, which is voice-activated and sends an SOS along with the user's location to emergency contacts. The primary industries to consider are:\n\n1. Technology - because the core offering is a mobile application with specific functionalities like voice activation and location tracking.\n2. Safety/Security - because the app's primary purpose is to enhance personal safety by providing a quick way to alert emergency contacts.\n\nThe primary industry is Technology, as the app's development, functionality, and delivery are fundamentally technological. However, the app's purpose is deeply rooted in personal safety, making Safety/Security a significant secondary industry. The app's value proposition is centered around improving emergency response times, which aligns with safety and security concerns.\n\nPrimary Industry: Technology - The app's development and functionality are technology-driven.\nSecondary Industry: Safety/Security - The app's purpose is to enhance personal safety in emergencies.\n\nTARGET AUDIENCE ANALYSIS:\nThe app is designed for individuals who may find themselves in emergency situations and need a quick way to alert their contacts. The potential target audiences include:\n\n1. Consumers - individuals who want to enhance their personal safety.\n2. Businesses - organizations that might provide this app to employees for safety purposes.\n3. Government - agencies that might promote or distribute the app for public safety.\n\nThe primary target audience is Consumers, as the app is designed for personal use by individuals who want to ensure their safety. While businesses and government agencies could be secondary users or promoters, the app's primary function is for individual consumer use.\n\nPRODUCT TYPE ANALYSIS:\nThe business offers a mobile application with specific features like voice activation, location tracking, and audio recording. The product type considerations include:\n\n1. Mobile App - as the app is accessed and used on mobile devices.\n2. Service - as it provides a service of alerting contacts and recording audio in emergencies.\n\nThe most accurate product type classification is Mobile App, as the primary interaction and value delivery occur through the mobile application itself. The service aspect is inherent in the app's functionality but does not change the product type classification.\n\nREVIEW AND FINAL DECISION:\n- Primary Industry: Technology is appropriate as the app's development and functionality are technology-driven.\n- Secondary Industry: Safety/Security is appropriate as the app's purpose is to enhance personal safety.\n- Target Audience: Consumers are the primary users seeking personal safety solutions.\n- Product Type: Mobile App best describes the delivery method and user interaction."
