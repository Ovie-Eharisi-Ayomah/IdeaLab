  "reasoning": "INDUSTRY ANALYSIS:\nThis business idea involves a mobile app that connects dog owners with dog walkers. The primary industries to consider are:\n\n1. Pet Services - because the core value proposition is providing a service related to pet care, specifically dog walking.\n2. Technology - because the service is facilitated through a mobile app, which is a digital platform.\n\nThe primary focus of the business is on pet services, as the app's main function is to connect dog owners with dog walkers, which is a pet care service. The technology component, while essential for facilitating the connection, is not the core value proposition but rather the means of delivery. Therefore, the primary industry is Pet Services. Technology could be considered a secondary industry due to the app's role in enabling the service.\n\nPrimary Industry: Pet Services\nSecondary Industry: Technology\n\nTARGET AUDIENCE ANALYSIS:\nThe business connects dog owners with dog walkers, indicating two primary user groups:\n\n1. Dog Owners - who need the service of dog walking.\n2. Dog Walkers - who provide the service.\n\nThe primary paying customers are likely the dog owners, as they would be the ones paying for the dog walking service. The app likely generates revenue from dog owners, either through a fee per walk or a subscription model. Therefore, the primary target audience is Consumers (dog owners).\n\nPRODUCT TYPE ANALYSIS:\nThe business offers a mobile app that connects two user groups and facilitates transactions between them. This is a classic marketplace model, where the app acts as a platform connecting service providers (dog walkers) with service seekers (dog owners). The core product type is a Marketplace, as the app's primary function is to facilitate these connections and transactions.\n\nREVIEW AND FINAL DECISION:\nLooking at my analysis holistically:\n- Primary Industry: Pet Services is most appropriate as the core offering is related to pet care.\n- Secondary Industry: Technology is appropriate as the app is essential for service delivery.\n- Target Audience: Consumers (dog owners) are the primary paying customers.\n- Product Type: Marketplace best describes the two-sided platform model."
