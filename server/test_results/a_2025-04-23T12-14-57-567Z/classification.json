  "reasoning": "INDUSTRY ANALYSIS:\nThe business idea involves a mobile app that connects dog owners with dog walkers. The primary industries to consider are:\n\n1. Pet Services - because the core value proposition is providing a service related to pet care, specifically dog walking.\n2. Technology - because the service is facilitated through a mobile app, which is a digital platform.\n\nThe primary focus of the business is on pet services, as the app's main function is to connect dog owners with dog walkers, which is a pet care service. The technology component, while essential for facilitating the connection, is not the primary value proposition. Therefore, the primary industry is Pet Services. Technology can be considered a secondary industry because the app is a critical enabler of the service.\n\nPrimary Industry: Pet Services - The core offering is a service related to pet care.\nSecondary Industry: Technology - The app is essential for connecting users and facilitating the service.\n\nTARGET AUDIENCE ANALYSIS:\nThe business connects dog owners with dog walkers, indicating two primary user groups:\n\n1.

This is a classic marketplace model, where the app acts as a platform connecting dog owners with dog walkers.
