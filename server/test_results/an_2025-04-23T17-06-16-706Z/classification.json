  "reasoning": "INDUSTRY ANALYSIS:\nThe business idea involves an AI-powered tool that validates business ideas by analyzing market size, competition, and demand. The primary industries to consider are:\n\n1. Technology - because the core offering is an AI-powered tool, which is fundamentally a technological solution.\n2. Business Services - because the tool is designed to assist with business idea validation, which is a business consultancy function.\n\nThe primary industry is Technology, as the AI component is central to the product's functionality and value proposition. The tool's ability to analyze and validate business ideas is driven by its technological capabilities. While Business Services is relevant, it is more of an application area rather than the core industry, as the tool itself is not providing consulting services but rather enabling them through technology.\n\nPrimary Industry: Technology\nSecondary Industry: None - The business services aspect is not significant enough to warrant a secondary classification, as the primary value is derived from the AI technology itself.\n\nTARGET AUDIENCE ANALYSIS:\nThe tool is designed to validate business ideas, which suggests its primary users are likely to be entrepreneurs, startups, or existing businesses looking to explore new ventures. The potential customer types include:\n\n1. Entrepreneurs and Startups - individuals or small teams looking to validate new business ideas.\n2. Established Businesses - companies exploring new product lines or market expansions.\n\nGiven the focus on validating business ideas, the primary target audience is Businesses, as they are the ones most likely to invest in tools that can provide insights into market size, competition, and demand for potential ventures. While individual entrepreneurs may also use the tool, the broader category of businesses encompasses both startups and established companies.\n\nTarget Audience: Businesses\n\nPRODUCT TYPE ANALYSIS:\nThe product is an AI-powered tool, which suggests a digital solution. The potential product types include:\n\n1. SaaS (Software as a Service) - if the tool is offered as a cloud-based service with a subscription model.\n2. Software - if the tool is a standalone application that users purchase or license.\n\nGiven the nature of AI tools and the trend towards cloud-based solutions, it is likely that this tool would be offered as a SaaS product. This would allow users to access the tool online, benefit from regular updates, and pay on a subscription basis, which is common for AI-driven analytics tools.\n\nProduct Type: SaaS\n\nREVIEW AND FINAL DECISION:\nReviewing the analysis, the classifications align well with the business idea's description. The primary industry is Technology due to the AI-driven nature of the tool. The target audience is Businesses, as they are the primary users of business validation tools. The product type is SaaS, reflecting the likely delivery method and business model for an AI-powered tool."
