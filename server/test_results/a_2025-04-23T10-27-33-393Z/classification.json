  "reasoning": "INDUSTRY ANALYSIS:\nThe business idea involves a mobile app that connects dog owners with dog walkers. The primary industries to consider are:\n1. Pet Services - because the core value proposition is providing a service related to pet care, specifically dog walking.\n2. Technology - because the service is facilitated through a mobile app.\n\nThe primary focus of the business is on pet services, as the app's main function is to connect dog owners with dog walkers, which is a pet care service. The technology component, while essential for facilitating the connection, is not the primary value proposition but rather the means of delivery. Therefore, the primary industry is Pet Services. Technology could be considered a secondary industry since the app is crucial for the service delivery.\n\nTARGET AUDIENCE ANALYSIS:\nThe primary users of this app are dog owners who need walking services for their pets. These are individual consumers rather than businesses or government entities. The app is designed to meet the needs of pet owners looking for convenience and care for their dogs. Therefore, the target audience is Consumers.\n\nPRODUCT TYPE ANALYSIS:\nThe business offers a mobile app that connects two user groups: dog owners and dog walkers. This is a classic marketplace model where the app acts as a platform to facilitate transactions and connections between service providers (dog walkers) and service seekers (dog owners). While the app is the delivery method, the core product type is a Marketplace, as it connects multiple parties and facilitates service transactions.\n\nREVIEW AND FINAL DECISION:\n- Primary Industry: Pet Services is most appropriate as the core offering is related to pet care.\n- Secondary Industry: Technology is appropriate as the app is essential for service delivery.\n- Target Audience: Consumers are the primary users and customers of the app.\n- Product Type: Marketplace best describes the platform model connecting dog owners with dog walkers."
