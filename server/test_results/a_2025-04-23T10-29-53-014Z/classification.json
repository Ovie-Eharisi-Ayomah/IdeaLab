  "reasoning": "INDUSTRY ANALYSIS:\nThe business idea involves a mobile app that connects dog owners with dog walkers. The primary industries to consider are:\n\n1. Pet Services - because the core value proposition is providing a service related to pet care, specifically dog walking.\n2. Technology - because the service is facilitated through a mobile app, which is a digital platform.\n\nThe primary focus of the business is on pet services, as the app's main function is to connect dog owners with dog walkers, which is a pet care service. The technology aspect, while important for delivery, is secondary to the primary service being offered. Therefore, the primary industry is Pet Services. Technology serves as an enabler but does not define the core offering, so it is not significant enough to warrant a secondary industry classification.\n\nTARGET AUDIENCE ANALYSIS:\nThe app connects dog owners with dog walkers, indicating two main user groups:\n\n1. Dog owners - who are seeking the service of dog walking.\n2. Dog walkers - who provide the service.\n\nThe primary paying customers are likely the dog owners, as they are the ones who would pay for the dog walking service. The app likely generates revenue from dog owners, possibly through transaction fees or subscription models. Therefore, the primary target audience is Consumers, specifically dog owners.\n\nPRODUCT TYPE ANALYSIS:\nThe business offers a mobile app that connects two user groups (dog owners and dog walkers) and facilitates transactions between them. This is a classic marketplace model, where the app acts as a platform to connect service providers (dog walkers) with service seekers (dog owners). The core product type is a Marketplace, as it facilitates the exchange of services between two parties.\n\nREVIEW AND FINAL DECISION:\nLooking at the analysis holistically:\n- Primary Industry: Pet Services is most appropriate as the core offering is related to pet care.\n- Secondary Industry: None, as the technology aspect is not significant enough to warrant a secondary classification.\n- Target Audience: Consumers (dog owners) are the primary paying customers.\n- Product Type: Marketplace best describes the two-sided platform model."
