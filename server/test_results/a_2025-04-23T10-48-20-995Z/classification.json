  "reasoning": "INDUSTRY ANALYSIS:\nThis business idea involves a mobile app that connects dog owners with dog walkers. The primary industries to consider are:\n1. Pet Services - because the core value proposition is providing a service related to pet care\n2. Technology - because the service is facilitated through a mobile app\n\nThe primary focus of this business is on pet services, specifically connecting dog owners with dog walkers. The app is a tool to facilitate this connection, but the core offering is the service of dog walking. Therefore, Pet Services is the primary industry. Technology plays a significant role as the app is essential for connecting users, scheduling, and possibly handling payments, making it a relevant secondary industry.\n\nPrimary Industry: Pet Services - The core offering is related to pet care services.\nSecondary Industry: Technology - The app is crucial for facilitating the service.\n\nTARGET AUDIENCE ANALYSIS:\nThe business connects dog owners with dog walkers. The primary users and paying customers are dog owners who need walking services for their pets. While dog walkers are also users of the app, they are service providers rather than customers. Therefore, the primary target audience is Consumers, specifically pet owners.\n\nPRODUCT TYPE ANALYSIS:\nThe business delivers value through a mobile application that connects two user groups (dog owners and dog walkers). This is a classic marketplace model where the app facilitates the connection and possibly manages transactions between the two parties. While it's delivered as an app, the core product type is a Marketplace, as it connects service providers with customers.\n\nREVIEW AND FINAL DECISION:\nLooking at my analysis holistically:\n- Primary Industry: Pet Services is most appropriate as the core offering is related to pet care.\n- Secondary Industry: Technology is appropriate as the app is essential for service delivery.\n- Target Audience: Consumers (dog owners) are the primary paying customers.\n- Product Type: Marketplace best describes the two-sided platform model."
