  "reasoning": "INDUSTRY ANALYSIS:\nThe business idea involves a mobile app that connects dog owners with dog walkers. The primary industry candidates are:\n1. Pet Services - because the core value proposition is providing a service related to pet care\n2. Technology - because the service is facilitated through a mobile app\n\nThe primary focus of the business is on pet care services, specifically connecting dog owners with dog walkers. The app is a tool that enables this service, but the fundamental value is in the pet care service itself. Therefore, Pet Services is the primary industry. Technology is a significant enabler of the service, as the app is essential for connecting users, but it is not the core value proposition. Thus, Technology can be considered a secondary industry.\n\nTARGET AUDIENCE ANALYSIS:\nThe app connects dog owners with dog walkers, indicating two user groups:\n1. Dog owners (consumers seeking the service)\n2. Dog walkers (service providers)\n\nThe primary paying customers are likely the dog owners, as they are the ones seeking and paying for the dog walking service. The dog walkers are service providers who benefit from the platform but are not the primary source of revenue. Therefore, the primary target audience is Consumers.\n\nPRODUCT TYPE ANALYSIS:\nThe business offers a mobile app that connects two user groups and facilitates transactions between them. This is a classic marketplace model, where the app serves as a platform to connect dog owners with dog walkers. The app itself is the medium through which the service is accessed, but the core product type is a Marketplace, as it connects service providers with consumers.\n\nREVIEW AND FINAL DECISION:\n- Primary Industry: Pet Services is most appropriate as the core offering is related to pet care.\n- Secondary Industry: Technology is appropriate as the app is essential for service delivery.\n- Target Audience: Consumers are the primary paying customers seeking the service.\n- Product Type: Marketplace best describes the platform connecting dog owners with dog walkers."
