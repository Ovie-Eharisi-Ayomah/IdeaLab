  "reasoning": "INDUSTRY ANALYSIS:\nThe business idea involves a mobile app that connects dog owners with dog walkers. The primary industries to consider are:\n\n1. Pet Services - because the core value proposition is providing a service related to pet care, specifically dog walking.\n2. Technology - because the service is facilitated through a mobile app, which is a digital platform.\n\nThe primary focus of the business is on pet services, as the app's main function is to connect dog owners with dog walkers, which is a pet care service. While the technology (mobile app) is crucial for enabling these connections, it serves as a tool rather than the core offering. Therefore, the primary industry is Pet Services. Technology could be considered a secondary industry since the app is essential for service delivery.\n\nPrimary Industry: Pet Services - The core offering is a service related to pet care.\nSecondary Industry: Technology - The app is a critical enabler of the service.\n\nTARGET AUDIENCE ANALYSIS:\nThe business connects dog owners with dog walkers, indicating two main user groups:\n\n1. Dog owners (consumers) who need walking services for their pets.\n2. Dog walkers (service providers) who offer their services.\n\nThe primary paying customers are likely the dog owners, as they would be the ones paying for the walking services. The app likely generates revenue through fees or commissions from these transactions. Therefore, the primary target audience is Consumers.\n\nPRODUCT TYPE ANALYSIS:\nThe business delivers value through a mobile app that connects two user groups (dog owners and dog walkers). This is a classic marketplace model, where the app facilitates transactions between service providers and consumers. While it's delivered as an app, the core product type is a Marketplace, as it connects two parties and facilitates service transactions.\n\nREVIEW AND FINAL DECISION:\nLooking at the analysis holistically:\n- Primary Industry: Pet Services is most appropriate as the core offering is related to pet care.\n- Secondary Industry: Technology is appropriate as the app is essential for service delivery.\n- Target Audience: Consumers (dog owners) are the primary paying customers.\n- Product Type: Marketplace best describes the two-sided platform model."
