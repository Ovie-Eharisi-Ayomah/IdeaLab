# Step-by-Step Methodology for Market Sizing from Scratch

## 1. Define Your Assumptions Clearly

- Document all initial assumptions about the business idea
- Create a foundational hypothesis about what problem is being solved
- Establish clear parameters for what constitutes a "customer"

## 2. Industry Research Blitz

- Identify the broader industry category and all relevant sub-categories
- Find 3-5 industry reports from sources like Statista, IBISWorld, or Gartner
- Look for public companies' annual reports in the same space
- Search for industry association data and publications

## 3. Initial TAM Framework Construction

- Start with the broadest possible definition of your market
- Use multiple calculation methods:
  - Population-based: Total potential users × price
  - Value-based: Problem cost × frequency × addressable population
  - Industry-report based: Relevant segment values from reports

## 4. Customer Segment Deep Dive

- Break down each potential customer segment by:
  - Demographics (age, location, income, etc.)
  - Psychographics (interests, values, pain points)
  - Behavioral characteristics (adoption patterns, buying habits)
- Size each segment using census data, industry reports, or research panels

## 5. Bottom-Up Construction

- For each identified segment:
  - Determine segment size
  - Estimate penetration rates (using analogous products/services)
  - Calculate segment value (users × price × frequency)
- Sum all segments to create bottom-up TAM

## 6. Top-Down Validation

- Use broader industry figures to check your bottom-up calculations
- Apply relevant filters to narrow the market (geographic, demographic, etc.)
- Compare the results against your bottom-up approach

## 7. Penetration Rate Estimation

- For each segment, examine:
  - Adoption patterns of similar products/solutions
  - Barriers to adoption (switching costs, education required)
  - Competitive intensity in the segment
- Apply adoption curve principles (early adopters vs. mainstream)

## 8. Refine with Primary Research

- Conduct quick surveys or interviews with potential customers
- Test willingness to pay assumptions
- Validate problem severity and solution desirability

## 9. SAM & SOM Calculations

- SAM: Apply realistic constraints to your TAM
  - Geographic limitations
  - Technological requirements
  - Regulatory considerations
- SOM: Factor in your specific business constraints
  - Marketing reach and budget
  - Sales capacity
  - Product readiness timeline

## 10. Sensitivity Analysis

- Create multiple scenarios (conservative, moderate, optimistic)
- Identify the key variables that most impact your market size
- Document confidence levels for each assumption
