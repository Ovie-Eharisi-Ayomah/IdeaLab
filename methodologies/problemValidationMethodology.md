Idea Lab's Problem Validation Framework
1. AI-Powered Search Evidence Collection
Implement the browser-use agent pattern shown in problem_validation.py to:

Perform targeted searches for evidence of the problem using multiple queries
Analyze search volumes for problem-related keywords (indicating awareness)
Gather statistics from industry reports and research studies
Extract discussions from forums and communities
Analyze product reviews of alternative solutions

2. Structured Evidence Classification
For each piece of evidence found, classify:

Type: Research study, forum post, news article, review
Source: Original website or publication
Date: When the evidence was published
Sentiment: Positive, negative, or neutral
Relevance: How directly it relates to the stated problem

3. Problem Validation Metrics
Calculate and present:

Existence Score (1-10): Based on volume and quality of evidence
Severity Score (1-10): Based on sentiment analysis and impact statements
Frequency Score (1-10): How often the problem occurs for users
Willingness to Pay (1-10): Evidence of spending on alternative solutions

4. Alternative Solutions Analysis
For each existing solution identified:

Document the approach they take
Identify specific limitations users report
Analyze sentiment around these alternatives
